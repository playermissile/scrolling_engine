Atari 8-bit Fine Scrolling Game Engine
======================================================================

**Revision 0, updated 17 Dec 2019**

This is a tutorial on the creation and development of a fine scrolling game engine for the Atari 8-bit series of computers.

This is tutorial assumes familiarity with 6502 assembly language, the scrolling
features of the ANTIC coprocessor, display list interrupts, vertical blank
interrupts, and probably some other stuff that won't be covered in depth here.
For background on other subjects covered in this tutorial, see my other
tutorials:

 * :ref:`Display List Interrupts: A Complete(ish) Tutorial <dli_tutorial>`
 * :ref:`Fine Scrolling: A Complete(ish) Tutorial <scrolling_tutorial>`

and some other references:

 * `Altirra Hardware Reference Manual (PDF) <http://www.virtualdub.org/downloads/Altirra%20Hardware%20Reference%20Manual.pdf>`_

All the examples here are assembled using the MAC/65-compatible assembler
`ATasm <https://atari.miribilist.com/atasm/index.html>`_ (and more specifically
to this tutorial, the version built-in to `Omnivore
<https://github.com/robmcmullen/omnivore>`_).

.. note:: All source code and XEX files are available in the `scrolling_engine source code repository <https://github.com/playermissile/scrolling_engine>`_ on github.
